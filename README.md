# Vim Miscellanea

My vim setup is broken into individual [plugins][], all of which come 
together in my [vimrc][] via [Vundle][].

This one happens to be a grab-bag of miscellaneous settings and maps 
which don't seem to form anything cohesive. Feel free to install this 
bundle, but understand it may depend on other bundles I happen to use. 

If you wish to use my entire setup, simply copy my [vimrc][] and 
`:BundleInstall` all the things listed therein.

[plugins]: https://github.com/search?q=vim+%40pbrisbin&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=VimL
[vimrc]: http://github.com/pbrisbin/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc
[Vundle]: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

## Installation

1. Use [Vundle][]
2. Add `Bundle 'pbrisbin/vim-config'` to `~/.vimrc`

See [here][vimrc] for an example.
