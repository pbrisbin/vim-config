# Vim configuration

This is my vim.

### What this is tweaked/extended for

* Haskell
* Pandoc markdown
* Emails

If you primarily use vim for day-to-day text editing plus these tasks, 
you might find my setup enjoyable.

### What this is not tweaked/extended for

* C/C++
* Python
* Ruby

If you develop heavily in these languages, you might consider someone 
else's setup.

### Installation

1. Backup your existing setup
2. Copy this repo's contents into ~/.vim
3. `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vim`
